<h1>We help you help others</h1>
 
<p>
	Thank you for visiting idozo "the better way to give". By connecting potential donors with nonprofit organizations, we can reach and help millions of needy people.
</p>
<p>
	We know there are millions of potential donors who want to help those in need. However, often times they do not know who needs their items, where to give, or what happens to their donation. Through the idozo, potential donors do not need to know the answers to these questions prior to posting their items for donation. Nonprofits will answer most donor questions in the act of requesting their posted donation. If nonprofits do not find what they require, they can post specific Needs (requests).
</p>
<p>
	Part of our mission is to make the giving process more rewarding. By having nonprofits provide feedback on accepted donations, donors will know how their item was helpful. Again, thank you for visiting idozo and we look forward to your participation
